Fully autonomous [screeps] AI.

[Screeps] is a JavaScript based MMO game, where all actions are controlled through scripts. Some opt to manually
trigger their empire's operation, while others attempt fully autonomous codebases. This is the latter.

This repository uses [Transcrypt] to compile python to JavaScript.
